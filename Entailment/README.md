# Recognizing Textual Entailment (Natural Language Inference (NLI))



# What is NLI?
Natural Language Inference or Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) is the task of classifying a pair of premise and hypothesis sentences into three classes: contradiction, neutral, and entailment. For example:

| Premise | Hypothesis | Label|
|---------|------------|------|
|A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country. | The man is sleeping. | contradiction |
| An older and younger man smiling. |Two men are smiling and laughing at the cats playing on the floor. | neutral |
| A soccer game with multiple males playing. | Some men are playing a sport. | Entailment |
