# Syntactic Similarity

# What is syntactic similarity. 

Syntactic similarity is a measure of how similar two pieces 

## Models

The **Smith Waterman Algorithm** (S-W) implements a technique called dynamic programming, which takes alignments of any length, at any location, in any sequence, and determines whether an optimal alignment can be found. Based on these calculations, scores or weights are assigned to each character-to-character comparison: positive for exact matches/substitutions, negative for insertions/deletions. In weight matrices, scores are added together and the highest scoring alignment is reported.
